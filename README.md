Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requrements and goals of the application was to make an inventory app that was able to store the inventory data of a company and allow them to access and change the data through the application. The needs of the user addressed was to have their inventory be able to be scanned into the system and have the system update when there was a change in the inventory, allowing ti to be fully managed by the application. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens needed were a login screen for the different roles of either admin, or emplyee or clients to be able to allow certain permissions with the inventory app. The inventory table of listed items in the inventory which could show and edit the data in realtime for the inventory system to be updated. And lastly the screen for notification setup allowing the application to send notifications of updates if needed. This was designed with users in mind to have a simple UI which was easily accessible. The deisnged themselves worked for their purpose but was not able to be fully implemented. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the process by thinking about what the user needed and how to make that as easy as possible for them to achieve. I used simple UI design techniques to make the app very easy to use so there would be no confusion, allowing basic functionality in case the users were not familiar with how inventory applications worked. This can be applied to many other application designs as well, having a simple design is better overall for users as it leads to the least amount of error when testing and launching the app. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested the code by following the guidelines and scanning for errors as they popped up. This is important to make sure your code is functional and will work if it gets launched and implemented. As for me my code was not fully functional and had some errors which I need to work on. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

In my case I was fairly new to mobile application development so I had to innovate a lot during the process, I was able to build up the foundations and struture of the application but in the end still have the challenge of making my apps fully functional which is something I will need to develop into the future.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe I was successful in demonstrating my application design with UI, I think my simple layout did well at providing the functionlity of the application in a simple ease of use way for users to understand and use without error.
